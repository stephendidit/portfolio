                    <p>I worked on a team of two on this project. I ideated, wireframed, and implemented the Ruby / Sinatra / layout / JS / d3.js / neo4j portions. Dynamically visualizes a graph database of ~40k nodes and 100k connections. Strong focus on optimizing query time via Ruby. Focus on recently departed celebrities (Bowie, Prince, Merle Haggard), and the Richmond, VA local music scene. Part of a larger project, this is why I learned to code--to automate processes I'd done manually, in which my MVP eventually hit a 4.0 viral coefficient--but it took 4 hours to make each visualization manually. It now takes ~6 seconds.</p>

                    <p>I found unexploited loopholes in international treaties, so I developed a process of getting around the US Copyright Office to produce nonrepudiable evidence valid in all international courts (except Somalia and Uganda). I wrote a provisional patent for a portion of it, with guidance from DOD security contractors and IP attorneys for the UN. A Chinese/Israeli/American company invested in it, which ended in a bang! when Dr. Dre/Beats Music came after us for trademark violation over the name in China right before Apple acquired them.</p>

My time as a startup founder helped me develop a keen sense of what's working, what's not, and how to prioritize solutions. The challenge and pursuit of elegance both visually and under-the-hood is as fun for me as is rapidly putting out fires. As a commercial composer, I've excelled in communicating many musical "languages" to solve the problems of multiple stakeholders. The bulk of composition is in knowing the right tool for the job, teamwork, and rapidly responding to project changes--I translate these skills into web development. I'm a quick study, where I learn best through immersion in new languages and concepts for the sake of solving specific problems. I love finding and exploiting patterns and systems, and drawing solutions from diverse fields. Like all creative domains, web development constantly evolves--new rules, new trends, and new things to learn. I look forward with excitement to being a part of what's next.</p>

I compose music for commercials, produce my own songs, and perform with a Led Zeppelin tribute band, a klezmer/gypsy/jazz band, and a synth-pop group whose songs are all about Chile. I enjoy reading, where I'm usually in the middle of some 20 books (I have a system, and I'm great at compartmentalizing). Some of the books I'm reading right now include: <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em> (artificial intelligence), <em>Rites of Spring</em> (WWI's influence on art), and <em>Les Miserables</em> (bread).</p>
